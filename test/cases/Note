Running notes:
1) damp_opt and dampcoef must be set correctly for extremely high resolution (see namelist for TP)
2) ice_para must be 1 or 2, otherwise crash. progn_ice is used for control.
if ice_para is set to 0, the model will crash after two time step when reaching dry deposition 
3) The namelist in hemisphere can be followed for nested run 
4) real.exe speed sometimes depends on how many nodes used. Using a single node sometimes can be much faster than using more nodes. 
5) Compiling flags can significantly affect the simulation speed
Much faster:
CFLAGS_LOCAL    =       -w -O3 -ip -xHost -fp-model fast=2 -no-prec-div -no-prec-sqrt -ftz -no-multibyte-chars
LDFLAGS_LOCAL   =       -ip -xHost -fp-model fast=2 -no-prec-div -no-prec-sqrt -ftz -align all -fno-alias -fno-common
Slower:
CFLAGS_LOCAL    =       -w -O3 -ip #-xHost -fp-model fast=2 -no-prec-div -no-prec-sqrt -ftz -no-multibyte-chars
LDFLAGS_LOCAL   =       -ip #-xHost -fp-model fast=2 -no-prec-div -no-prec-sqrt -ftz -align all -fno-alias -fno-common
6) Compiling with different modules may significantly affect the simulation speed (real.exe can be 10 Times different, wrf.exe can be 2 times different). 
For examples, on AEMOL, the modules below can be much faster than the modules with intel MPI:
##Faster
module load intelcompiler-15.0.1
module load mpi/openmpi-2.1.0
module load hdf5-1.10.1
module load netcdf-4.6.0
module load pnetcdf-1.9.0
##Slower
module load mpi/mpich3.1-icc
module load cmake-3.5.1
module load intelcompiler-15.0.1
module load mpas/pnetcdf-1.9.0
module load mpas/netcdf-4.4.1
7) WRF-Chem sometimes has the error message below, it may due to the compiling switch, in particular if the error occurs at the beginning of run. It can be improved with adding "FCDEBUG = -heap-arrays" in configure.wrf
 -------------- FATAL CALLED ---------------
 FATAL CALLED FROM FILE:  <stdin>  LINE:      76
  *** exceeded lsodes failure limit =        1000
 -------------------------------------------
8) It is found that sometimes the model runs very slow particularly for real.exe, it may be due to the parallel communication is through ethernet instead of infiniband (IB) that is required for parallel computing. In addition, openmpi can use IB for parallel with some running parameters after mpirun, while mpich is more difficult to use IB. 
9) Some switches in configure.wrf can cause WRF run with unstable speed, it has to be used with caution if the default switches need to be adjusted.
